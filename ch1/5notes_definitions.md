# Definitions

## Subsets, proper subsets, supersets
$A \subseteq B$ means that every element of A is an element of B. B is sometimes called the superset of A.

$A \subset B$ means that every element of A is an element of B, and that **A and B are not equal.**

# Set Theorems

## Unionized subset equivalence
For a set $A$ and $B$ where $A \subset B$, $A \cup B = B$

## Function-set mapping

For any function $f : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ we can write the image of f under A as $f(A) = {f(x) : x \in A}$

## Function-image subset theorem

For a function $f$, and for sets a and b where $a \subseteq b$, then: 

$$f(a) \subseteq f(b)$$

## Subset Transience Theorem

$$(a \subseteq b) \land (b \subseteq c) \rightarrow a \subseteq c$$

Example proof for a fact about numbers:

> Every multiple of 9100 is also a multiple of 13. We could factor 9100, but here is an easier way. The set of multiples of 9100 is a subset of the set of multiples of 91. And the set of multiples of 91 is a subset of the set of multiples of 13. Now apply the proposition above.
