## 9. For all integers $n$, if $n$ is odd, then $7n$ is odd. Prove the statement

### Direct proof 

Consider a number n where n is an odd integer. Based on the definition of an odd number, n can be represented by 2a + 1 where a is any integer. $7(2a + 1) = 14a + 7$. $14a$ must be even, since 2 is a factor of 14. 
Therefore, 14a + 7 is odd because an even number plus an odd number is odd.

### Converse: For all integers $n$, if $7n$ is odd, then $n$ is odd.

Proof by contradiction. Consider an integer $n$ where $7n$ is odd, and $n$ is even. Since $n$ is even, it can be represented by $2a$ where a is an integer. Therefore, $7n = 14a$. $7n$ must be even, since 2 is a factor of 14. However, that contradicts the assumption that 7n must be odd. Therefore, for all integers n, if 7n is odd, then n is odd.
