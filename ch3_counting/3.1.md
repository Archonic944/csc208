# 3.1: Pascal's Arithmetic Triangle

## Objectives

1. Use Pascal’s triangle to answer counting questions about lattice paths, bit strings, and subsets.
2. Explain how Pascal’s triangle is generated and how it relates to counting questions.
3. Explain why Pascal’s triangle is related to so many different types of counting problems.

## PASCAL'S TRIANGLE

<img src=https://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi4/generated/latex-image/pascal-large.svg>

A triangle where every number is the sum of the two numbers diagonally above it.

## Notation

Rows of the triangle start at 0, and columns start at 0.

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
n \\
k
\end{pmatrix}
$$

where n is row, and k is column. We call this n choose k.

## Lattice Path

integer lattice = set of all points in the cartesian plane for which both the x and y coordinates are integers.

**Lattice Path**: One of the shortest possible paths connecting two points on the lattice


## Finding the number of lattice paths

For the number of lattice paths from (0,0) to a point (m,n), first find the length $m + n = l$.

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
m + n \\
n
\end{pmatrix}
$$
