# 3.5 Counting Multisets

## Definition 3.5.1

A multiset is an unordered collection of elements, each of which can appear any number of times. The number of times an element appears is called its multiplicity.

### Notation

Same as sets: $\lbrace 1,2,2,5 \rbrace$

## Have Some Cookies

Distributing 7 cookies to 4 kids, each kid will end up with n cookies ($0 ≤ n ≤ 7$)

Not 7^4 because $n_1 + n_2 + n_3 + n_4 + n_5 + n_6 + n_7$ must add to 7

### Example 3.5.2

You grab a handful of ten jelly beans from a bag that contains six flavors. Write down three possible outcomes using both multisets and strings of numbers.

Outcome 1: $\lbrace A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A \rbrace$

Outcome 2: $130002$

Outcome 3: $\lbrace A,A,A,B,D,E,E,E,F,F \rbrace$

## Sticks and stones

Sticks and stones can be represented as a bit string, where every activated bit is 1 and every deactivated bit is 0.

Where $n$ = stones + sticks and $k$ = sticks
