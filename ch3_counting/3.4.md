# 3.4 Combinations and Permutations

**Permutation** - possible rearrangement of objects

### Example 3.4.3

Simply rearrange the elements in the codomain (8!)

## Permutation Notation

$P(n,k)$ is choosing $k$ objects from a larger collection of $n$ objects

Represented as n!/(n-k)!

## Counting Sets

### Example 3.4.8

It is just a 5 permutation of 5 elements- $P(5,5)$- times 12 choose 5, so

$$1,5! * {12 \choose 5}k$$

### Example 3.4.10

1. ${14 \choose 6}$
2. ${14 \choose 6}$ * 6!

### Closed Formula for Choosing

$${n \choose k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$

## When to use each

If counting sets, think combinations. If counting sequences, think permutations.

1. Yes, true, since 2! = 2 and to get permutations we multiply by the factorial
2. False, since 3! â‰  3
