# 3.3 Non Disjoint Outcomes

## Sums

- Currently, sum principle only works if the intersection of the two sets of outcomes is empty
- We must know the length of $A \cap B$ if we wanted to find non disjoint outcomes
- The number of outcomes is the sum minus the intersection


### Example 3.3.2

|A| = 5 choose 2 = 10
|B| = 5 choose 4 = 5

Apparently $A \cap B$ is 3 choose 2...?

### Example 3.3.3

It's just 12 + 5 + 8
25

Nope I'm wrong. It's 15; less than my number because A could be 1 and C could be 1 where there was only 1 student.

## Principle of Inclusion/Exclusion

For any finite sets $A$ and $B$,

$$|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| $$

### Example 3.3.5

Since we already know the intersection is 3 choose 2, it's 15 - 3 choose 2

## Cardinality of a union (3 sets)

For any finite sets $A$, $B$, and $C$,

$$|A \cup B \cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap C|$$

### Example 3.3.7

25 multiples of 2
16 multiples of 3
10 multiples of 5

8 multiples of 2 and 3
5 multiples of 2 and 51
3 multiples of 3 and 5

25 + 16 + 20 = 51
51 - 8 - 5 - 3 = 45
45 + 1 (there is 1 multiple of all three) = 46

## Distinctions with the Product Principle

Usage of the product principle doesn't apply when one set of outcomes changes based on another outcome.

### Example 3.3.8

1. 26 * 26 * 26
2. 26 * 25 * 24

### Example 3.3.9

Depending on what letter is selected as the first letter, the size of the outcomes change. For example Z being the first letter would restrict the outcomes of the next two letters more than A.
