# 3.2 Combining Outcomes

## Example 3.2.1

Your brother is thinking of the total amount of magnets and your sister is thinking of the set of outcomes

## Sum Principle

If an event $A$ results in $m$ outcomes, and event $B$ results in $n$ disjoint outcomes, then the event $A \text{ or } B$ results in $m + n$ outcomes.

Disjoint means that there is no way for A and B to both happen.

### Example 3.2.3

26 + 26 = 52

### Example 3.2.5

210 total strings

Remaining weight after "11" = 4
Remaining length = 8

11: 70

Remaining weight after "00" = 6
Remaining length is 8

00: 28

70 + 28 = 98

### Example 3.2.6

5 * 26 = 130

## Product Principle

If event $A$ can occur in $m$ ways, and each possibility for $A$ allows for exactly $n$ ways for event $B$ then the event "$A \text{ and } B$" can occur in m * n ways

### Example 3.2.8

5 * 26 = 130

Event A is selecting the vowel that starts the word, event B is selecting the second letter for the word.

### Example 3.2.9

(0,0) to (4,7) AND (4,7) to (10,10)

(4,7):

Len 11, Height 7

11 choose 7 = 330

(4,7) to (10,10):

Length 9, Height 3

9 choose 3 = 84

84 * 330 = 27,720

### Example 3.2.13. Counting functions.


4^5 since each of the 5 elements have 4 choices, 4 * 4 * 4 * 4 * 4

## Combining Principles

### Example 3.2.14

(0,0) to (9,9)

(0,0) to (2,6) and (2,6) to (9,9)

1. len 8, col 6
Down 8 column 6 in pascal's triangle
=28

2. len 7 + 3 = 10, col 9 - 6 = 3
=120

28 * 120 = 3360

or (0,0) to (6,2) and (6,2) to (9,9)

Len 8 col 2

28

Len 3 + 7, 10
Col 7

120

SO it's just 3360 huh

3360 + 3360 = 6,720

### Example 3.2.15

1: 3,5: +3
2: 4: +2
3: 1,5: +3
4: 2: +2
5: 1,3: +3

3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 13
