# 3.2 Combining Outcomes

## Example 3.2.1

Your brother is thinking of the total amount of magnets and your sister is thinking of the set of outcomes

## Sum Principle

If an event $A$ results in $m$ outcomes, and event $B$ results in $n$ disjoint outcomes, then the event $A \text{ or } B$ results in $m + n$ outcomes.

Disjoint means that there is no way for A and B to both happen.

### Example 3.2.3

26 + 26 = 52

### Example 3.2.5

210 total strings

Remaining weight after "11" = 4
Remaining length = 8

11: 70

Remaining weight after "00" = 6
Remaining length is 8

00: 28

70 + 28 = 98

### Example 3.2.6

5 * 26 = 130

## Product Principle

If event $A$ can occur in $m$ ways, and each possibility for $A$ allows for exactly $n$ ways for event $B$ then the event "$A \text{ and } B$" can occur in m * n ways

### Example 3.2.8

5 * 26 = 130

Event A is selecting the vowel that starts the word, event B is selecting the second letter for the word.

### Example 3.2.9

(0,0) to (4,7) AND (4,7) to (10,10)

(4,7):

Len 11, Height 7

11 choose 7 = 330

(4,7) to (10,10):

Length 9, Height 3

9 choose 3 = 84

84 * 330 = 27,720
