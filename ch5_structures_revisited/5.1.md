# 5.1 Sets Revisited

$A \\ B$ is the differences of sets A and B.

A set with a line on top of it is everything except that set.

# Practice Problems

3. Find the following cardinalities.

**a. $|A|$ when $A = \lbrace 2, 3, 4, 5,\ldots, 43\rbrace\text{.}$**

$A$ goes from 2-43, inclusive, so our answer is 43 - 2 + 1 = **42**.

**b. $|A|$ when $A = \lbrace x \in \mathbb{Z} : -4 \le x \le 92\rbrace\text{.}$**

Our set is every integer from -4 to 92, inclusive. So, our answer: 92 - (-4) + 1 = **97**.

**c. $|A \cap B|$ when $A = \lbrace x \in \mathbb{N} : x \le 30\rbrace$ and $B = \lbrace x \in \mathbb{N} : x \text{ is prime }\rbrace\text{.}$**

This time, we are finding the length of the intersection of all natural numbers from 0 to 30, inclusive, and all prime natural numbers.

In more human terms, all natural numbers from 0 to 30.

These numbers are $\lbrace 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29 \rbrace$

The cardinality of that set is **10**.
