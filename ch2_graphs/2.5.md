# 2.5 Graph Coloring

## Vertex Coloring

A coloring of vertexes is called a **vertex coloring**.

A **vertex coloring** is not valid if two adjacent vertexes share the same color.

A graph's **chromatic number** ( $\chi(G)$ ) is the minimum amount of colors needed for a valid **vertex coloring**.

### Cliques

A **clique** is a set of vertices all of which are adjacent. In other words, a clique of size n is just $K_n$

**clique number** = largest $K_n$ present in a graph

## Edge coloring

We consider 2 edges adjacent if they are incident to the same edge.

## Preview Activity

$C_n$ requires 3 colors if n is odd and 2 if n is even.

$K_n$ requires n colors.

A bipartate graph requires 2 colors.

## Theorem 2.5.2: The Four Color Theorem

If G is a planar graph, then the chromatic number is ≤4.

## Theorem 2.5.4

The chromatic number of graph $G$ is at least the clique number.

## Theorem 2.5.5: Brooks' Theorem

Any graph $G$ satisfies $\phi(G) ≤ \delta(G)$ unless $G$ is complete or an odd cycle.

## Theorem 2.5.7

For any graph G, the chromatic index is either $\delta(G) \text{or} \delta(G) + 1$
