# 2.6 Relations and Graphs

## Objectives:
Explain the relationship between a graph and a relation.

Determine whether a relation is reflexive, symmetric, or transitive.

Use an equivalence relation to partition a set and use a partition to define an equivalence relation.

## Binary relation

A set of ordered pairs. $A \times B$ is the set of **all** ordered pairs of elements from A and B.

$A \times B$ is a relation on sets $A$ and $B$ and $A \times A$ is a relation on the set A.

## Example 2.6.4

M relation on set A X A: 

$M = {(2,1),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(4,2),(6,2),(6,3),(6,6)}$

It would be a "directed multigraph" not a graph

## Definition 2.6.5

Given a binary relation $R$, $R^-1$ is the inverse of $R$. $$R^{-1} = \{(b,a) : (a,b) \in R\}$$

## Composition (Def 2.6.6)

## Properties of Relations

* Reflexive: $(a,a) \in A$ for all $a \in A$
* Symmetric: For all $a,b \in A$ if $(a,b) \in R$ then $(b,a) \in R$
* Transitive: For all $a,b,c \in A$, if $(a,b) \in R$ and $(b,c) \in R$, then $(a,c) \in R$

### Example of a irreflexive relation:

The "sums to zero" relation.

### Example of a antisymmetric relation:

≤

### Example of a non-transitive relation:

The "within 3" relation. Holds for $a \text{and} b$ for when $|a - b| ≤ 3$.

## Equivalence Relations

Equality is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. 

An **equivalence relation** is a relation that is reflexive, symmetric, transitive.

## Example 2.6.15

Given two integers
