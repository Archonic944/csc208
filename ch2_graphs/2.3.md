# Planar Graphs

A graph is "planar" if we can draw it without its edges crossing.

The outside region is included as a face.

# Euler's formula for planar graphs

For any connected planar graph with $v$ vertices, $e$ edges, and $f$ faces, we have $$v-e+f=2$$

# Theorem 2.3.1

$K_5$ is not planar.

Each face must be surrounded by 3+ edges (a boundary)

Total amount of boundaries = $B$

Each edge is used as a boundary twice (B = 2e)

Effectively we have 2 "boundaries" per edge. Even the ones on the outside of the graph.

$3f < B$

$3f < 2e$

Which is impossible because 5 - 10 + f = 2, therefore f = 7, and 21 is not less than 20.

# Theorem 2.3.2

$K_{3,3}$ is not planar

A bipartate graph contains no 3 edge cycles

Girth (minimum cycle length) is at least 4

Same but $4f < 2e$

# Theorem 2.3.4

There are exactly 5 regular polyhedra.

## Is $K_{4,3}$ planar?

7 vertices

4 * 3 + 3 * 4 = 24 degree total, /2 = 12 edges

v - e + f = 2

7 - 12 + f = 24

-5 + f = 24

f = 29

4f ≤ 2e

Definitely not
