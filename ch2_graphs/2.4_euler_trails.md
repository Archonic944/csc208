# 2.4 Euler Trails and Circuits

## Euler Walk

A path that uses every edge EXACTLY once and visits every vertex.

## Euler Circuit

An euler walk that is a cycle.

### Preview Activity

3a. $(a,b), (b,c), (c,e),(e,d),(d,b),(b,e),(e,f)$

### Euler Trails and Circuits

* A graph has an Euler Circuit if and only if the degree of every vertex is even
* A graph has an Euler Trail if and only if there are at most two vertices with odd degree.

## Hamilton Paths/Cycle

A path/cycle that uses every vertex exactly once, as opposed to using every edge exactly once.

# Reading Questions

1. No, it is not possible because a circuit is a trail.
2. A tree can have an euler trail but not a circuit.
3. What does "NP" mean
