# 2.1 Trees: Notes and practice
*Some practice was done on paper. Propositions were not noted because they are already in notes_and_definitions.md.*

### Forest

Multiple trees, disconnected

Number of trees = vertices - edges

### Tree

A graph that is connected and contains no cycles.

### Preview Activity

1. 7, yes, 7, yes

### Minimal criminal proof

Proving a proposition by using the smallest possible counterexample.

A proof to prove proposition 2.2.5 (A tree with $v$ vertices has $v - 1$ edges):

> 1. The proposition is not true for all trees.
> 2. Smallest possible coounterexample: $v=2$
> * We proved that the proposition works for v=1.
> 3. Because we are working with a tree, there must be a vertex with degree 1. Remove it along with its edge. (see prop 2.2.4)
> 4. Now there is only 1 vertex, $v=1$. We already proved that the tree with $v=1$ satisfied the proposition, therefore $e'=v'-1$.
> 5. We know that v' is v - 1 and e' is e - 1 (see step 3)
> 6. So, $e$ would have to be e' + 1, which does not check out because that would mean $e â‰  e' + 1$
>7. We have proved v=2. Now use v=2 to prove v=3.

### Spanning Tree

A spanning tree must include every vertex from a graph, and be a tree, and be a subgraph of that graph.

### Example 2.2.8

There are many different spanning trees that can be made with this graph.

### Rooted trees

A graph with a certain vertex $v$ designated as the root. Involves parents, children, descendants (grandchildren), ancestors (grandparents), and siblings (where siblings are not connected).

The relationships change if the root changes.

### BFS versus DFS

BFS visits every node in the same generation before moving onto nodes in the next generation. DFS travels as far down from the root as possible, then retreats back to see if anyone in the same generation had children.
