# 2.1 Trees: Notes and practice
*Some practice was done on paper. Propositions were not noted because they are already in notes_and_definitions.md.*

### Forest

Multiple trees, disconnected

Number of trees = vertices - edges

### Tree

A graph that is connected and contains no cycles.

### Preview Activity

1. 7, yes, 7, yes

### Minimal criminal proof (proof by induction)

Proving a proposition by using the smallest possible counterexample.

A proof to prove proposition 2.2.5 (A tree with $v$ vertices has $v - 1$ edges):

> 1. The proposition is not true for all trees.
> 2. Smallest possible coounterexample: $v=2$
> * We proved that the proposition works for v=1.
> 3. Because we are working with a tree, there must be a vertex with degree 1. Remove it along with its edge. (see prop 2.2.4)
> 4. Now there is only 1 vertex, $v=1$. We already proved that the tree with $v=1$ satisfied the proposition, therefore $e'=v'-1$.
> 5. We know that v' is v - 1 and e' is e - 1 (see step 3)
> 6. So, $e$ would have to be e' + 1, which does not check out because that would mean $e â‰  e' + 1$
>7. We have proved v=2. Now use v=2 to prove v=3.

### Spanning Tree

A spanning tree must include every vertex from a graph, and be a tree, and be a subgraph of that graph.

### Example 2.2.8

There are many different spanning trees that can be made with this graph.

### Rooted trees

A graph with a certain vertex $v$ designated as the root. Involves parents, children, descendants (grandchildren), ancestors (grandparents), and siblings (where siblings are not connected).

The relationships change if the root changes.

### BFS versus DFS

BFS visits every node in the same generation before moving onto nodes in the next generation. DFS travels as far down from the root as possible, then retreats back to see if anyone in the same generation had children.

## Additional Exercises

1. Which of the graphs are trees?

A is not a tree, B is a tree, C is a tree, D is not a tree because it is not connected

2. For each degree sequence below, decide whether it must always, must never, or could possibly be a degree sequence for a tree.

a. 4 + 4 = 8, 8/2 = 4, 5 vertices, 5-1 = 4, **yes**

b. 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 10, 10/2 = 5, 5 vertices, 5-1=4, **no**

c. 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 8, 8/2 = 4, **yes**

d. sum is 26, 26/2 = 13, 13 + 1 = 14, 14 vertices, **yes**

3. For each degree sequence below, decide whether it must always, must never, or could possibly be a degree sequence for a tree. Justify your answers.

a. **never**, at least two leaves theorem

b. sum = 10, 10/2 = 5, 5+1 = 6, 6 edges, at least two leaves, **always**

c. 12, 12/2 = 6, 6 vertices, 6 edges, so **never** because trees are e = v-1

d. 8 + 6 = 14, 2 + 6 = 8, 14/2 = 7, 7 edges, 8 vertices, at least two of degree 1, so **always**

4.  Suppose you have a graph with  vertices and  edges that satisfies $v = e+1$. Must the graph be a tree? Prove your answer.

No. While it is true that a tree must satisfy v = e + 1, it must also satisfy the at least two leaves theorem. Before that theory is satisfied, the graph is not necessarily a tree.

5. Prove that any graph (not necessarily a tree) that satisfies v > e + 1 will NOT be connected.

For a graph to be connected, it has to have a path between any two vertices. A tree, by definition, has the **least** possible amount of edges while still maintaining a path between any two vertices. If a graph has less edges than a tree, then it will not have a path between any two given vertices.

6. If a graph G with v vertices and e edges is connected and has v < e + 1, must it contain a cycle? Prove your answer.

Yes, it must contain a cycle.

By the definition of graph G, it must have more edges than a tree T with v vertices. Adding extra edges to a tree will cause it to have a cycle. G can be thought as the image of T with extra edges added. It must contain a cycle.

7. We define a forest to be a graph with no cycles.

a. A forest is many trees. The graph doesn't have to be connected. The graph has no cycles. Therefore the graph has multiple trees.

b. If the forest was a connected tree, it would have v-1 edges. But, we have disconnected the graph. In order to disconnect it, we removed m - 1 edges (to spawn m - 1 additional trees other than the first one). So, the answer is $v - 1 - (m - 1)$ or simply $v - m$.

c. Didn't I just do this?

8. Give a careful proof of Corollary 2.2.3: A graph is a forest if and only if there is at most one path between any pair of vertices. Use proof by contrapositive (and not a proof by contradiction) for both directions.

a. If there is not at most 1 path between any pair of vertices, then a graph is not a forest.

Suppose there is more than 1 path between a pair of vertices. That must mean that the graph contains a cycle. Therefore, it is not a forest.

b. If the graph is not a forest, then there are more than 1 paths between any pair of vertices.

The only conditions a graph has to meet to be a forest is that it must not contain a cycle. If the graph is not a forest, then it must have failed that condition. A graph that contains 2+ paths between any pair of vertices, by definition, contains a cycle. Therefore it is not a forest.

9. Give a careful minimal criminal proof that every tree is bipartite.

For a graph to be bipartate, it must be separable into two groups A and B, where none of each connect with any in the same group. A tree $T$ with v=2 is bipartate because you can separate the two vertices into A and B where there are literally no other As or Bs to connect with. When we add a new vertex, it must be of degree 1. That vertex will either be connected to a vertex in group a or group b, so then it can simply be assigned to the opposite group. The tree is bipartate because the tree before it is bipartate. Therefore, all trees are bipartate!
