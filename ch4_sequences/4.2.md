  a. 13, 17
  b. add, 4
  c. a(n-1) + 1; 1
  d. 1 + 4n

3. Closed formula: $a_n = \sum _{a=0}^n\left(a+1\right)$
   (the book won't accept it for some reason, it works though)

## The Triangular Sequence $T_n$

$$T_1=1, T_2=3, T_3=6, T_4=10$$

The common difference is increasing by a common difference.

Therefore, the sequence is the sequence of partial sums of the arithmetic sequence 1,2,3...

## Practice Problems

5. Consider the sequence that starts $3, 8, 13, 18, 23,\ldots$ where a_0 = 3\text{.}

**a. Which of the following could be a recursive definition for the sequence?**

- [ ] $a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$; $a_0 = 3$
- [ ] $a_n = 5 \cdot a_{n-1}$; $a_0 = 3$
- [X] $a_n = a_{n-1} + 5$; $a_0 = 3$
- [ ] $a_n = 3 \cdot 5^n$
- [ ] None of the above

The sequence seems to increase by 5 every time, with $a_0$ being 3. 
The correct answer is $a_n = a_{n-1} + 5$; $a_0 = 3$.

**b. Find the closed formula.**

Since it is an arithmetic sequence, the closed formula is $a_0 + dn$. $d$ is 5, so...

$$a_n = 3 + 5n$$

**c. Is 2598 a term of the sequence?**

Let's see if n is a whole number when we substitute 2598 for $a_n$.

$$2598 = 3 + 5n$$

$$2595 = 5n$$

$$n = 519$$

So yes, it is, and it is term 519.
