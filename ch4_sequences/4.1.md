# 4.1 Describing Sequences

## Closed vs. Recursive definition

In a recursive formula, you cannot find the current value of the sequence without finding values before it. Closed formulas only rely on mathematical operations to get the value of the sequence.

There is not always an easy way to find a closed sequence from a recursive definition.

### Example 4.1.7

First find the recursive definition: $2a_{n-1}+1$

Find first few values: 1,3,7,15

Kinda looks like $2^n - 1$

## Common Sequences

1,4,9,16,25: Square numbers.

1,3,6,10,15,21: Triangular numbers. Closed formula: $T_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$

1,2,4,8,16,32: Powers of 2

1,1,2,3,5,8,13: Fibonacci numbers
