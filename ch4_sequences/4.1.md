# 4.1 Describing Sequences

## Closed vs. Recursive definition

In a recursive formula, you cannot find the current value of the sequence without finding values before it. Closed formulas only rely on mathematical operations to get the value of the sequence.

There is not always an easy way to find a closed sequence from a recursive definition.

### Example 4.1.7

First find the recursive definition: $2a_{n-1}+1$

Find first few values: 1,3,7,15

Kinda looks like $2^n - 1$

## Common Sequences

1,4,9,16,25: Square numbers.

1,3,6,10,15,21: Triangular numbers. Closed formula: $T_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$

1,2,4,8,16,32: Powers of 2

1,1,2,3,5,8,13: Fibonacci numbers

## Partial Sums and Differences

Where $a_n$ is a sequence, the sequence of partial sums is $b_n = a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n\text{.}$

It is sometimes possible to find a closed formula.

# Practice Problems

5. For each sequence given below, find a closed formula for $a_n$ (assuming the first terms are always $a_0$) by relating it to another sequence for which you already know the formulas.

a. $0,2,8,18,32,50, \ldots$

b. $-2, -1, 6, 25, 62, 123, \ldots$

c. $0, 10, 30, 60, 100, 150, \ldots$

d. $0, 2, 7, 15, 26, 40, \ldots$

Let's remember our common sequences:

Starting with sequence a: $$0,2,8,18,32,50, \ldots$$

Differences:

+2, +6, +10, +14

+4, +4, +4

Seems like it would best be modeled quadratically

At this point, gabe realized that it was just square numbers times two.

Closed formula: 

$$a_n = n^2 \cdot 2$$

Next, sequence b: 

$$-2, -1, 6, 25, 62, 123, \ldots$$

Similar to the last problem, this one is 

$$n^3 - 2$$

Next, sequence c:

$$0, 10, 30, 60, 100, 150$$

Well, all of them are multiples of ten, so let's start by factoring those out.

$$0,1,3,6,10,15$$

This sequence is the same as the triangular numbers. Closed formula:

$$a_n = 10 \times n(n+1)/2$$
